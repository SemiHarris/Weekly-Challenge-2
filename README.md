# Weekly-Challenge-2

- I was tasked with creating website to you as my portfolio for my coding projects
- I used css and html to complete this assignment
- The hardest part about this assignment was making the main body which I used flex and grid to complete
- I also used meadia queries to help the site fit better on smaller screens
- I had to turn a div into a hype link so when the picture was clicked it would take your to the project
- Had you use psuedo classes on the images to make the fill more interactive
- I didn't have enought projects to link so I just used placeholder images and links to helpful sources that I used to complete this project
